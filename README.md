# danilo cv website


Hi! My name is Danlo Acosta. and i am a programming student at Chas Academy. 

One of our (the pupils) first and top exercises has been to create our own personal website that also holds our curriculum. It has HTML, CSS (obviously), JavaScript and JSON. This is my biggest achivement so far and i will keep working on it untill it has all the functinality i please.

Creating this website has been a thrill. Lots of frustration, lots of learning and a whole lot of fun!

If you find my work ok or even good, i just want you to know that it wouldn't had been made without the help from our teachers at Chas Academy. All my gratitude goes to Chas and our teachers!

Thank you for visiting.
